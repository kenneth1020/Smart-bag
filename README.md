A bag that secure your laptop from burglary 
# Description
This is an old high school project. I was lock to save most of it. Bust sadly I'm missing the final coding.
The project job was to disarm and rearm using the remote to control the device. When armed if the bag was open and the magnetic switch is apart. Then the alarm will triggered. You can make the bag make annoying alarm any time. Ive did add fun code for other option the user can used.
